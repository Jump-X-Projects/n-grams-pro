- Configure text preprocessing options (stopwords removal, punctuation removal, lowercasing).
- Generate and visualize **n-grams** (unigrams, bigrams, trigrams, etc.).
- Set frequency thresholds to focus on the most relevant n-grams.
- (Optional) Compute collocations, TF-IDF, and part-of-speech filtered n-grams.
- Visualize results in bar charts and word clouds.
- Download the results for offline analysis.
